## Overview

**Disclaimer:** This spec is not complete. Wording will be changed. Layouts will be changed. This is a living document that will be updated.

This project, in its first iteration, will aim simply to be a simulation of the physical card game.

## Scenarios
Ian likes playing Hanabi. He has some friends he wants to play with, but he's in bed and doesn't want to get dressed to go out and play. He goes to the Hanabi app, creates a room, and sends the room code to his friends so they can join him.

## Nongoals
This version of the application will not support:
* AI Teammates
* Main lobby chat
* Security on games (eg trying to access a game you aren't in fails)
