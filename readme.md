##Scrum Board
[This](https://trello.com/b/2FwsnZ7n/scrum) is what I'm working on right now. If you have suggestions, please let me know here or email me at [ianfox97@gmail.com](mailto:ianfox97@gmail.com)!

## v1.0 Released!
The server is functional! Next step is a client, but after that these changes will come with server 1.1:
* Users get notified of game updates with server-sent events (no more polling required!)
* History of moves  
* Player nicknames  
* Old games expire  
* Admin can change game modes before starting

For the most up to date list of planned features, check out the [scrum board](https://trello.com/b/2FwsnZ7n/scrum).
